The main goal of Hexle is to correctly guess all 4 hexadecimal digits of a randomly generated 16-bit number, in the least number of attempts. At the start of each game, the user is shown a subtraction operator (-) and an 4-bit number. This number, the hint, is equal to the result of the subtraction of the largest digit  with the smallest digit of the answer.
